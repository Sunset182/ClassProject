Hey there! Welcome to my blog, where I hope to show case the many things I enjoy and have learned along the way. So, stay awhile and you might just pick up a few things to take home and try! In my spare time, you can find me roasting up small batches of coffee, baking something new, or trying out a new seasoning concoctions out on a slab of meat. Truthfully, I'm a dabbler at heart and take up most opportunities to truly enjoy life.

During Christmas, baked goods are forever at your finger tips. So I tried my hand at an old recipe passed down from my grams, <em>Persimmon Bread</em>, and my oh my was that a hit. Luckily, I could save a few and bring them back for friends to try.
